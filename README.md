Make sure that "screen.h" is in the same directory as "main.cpp"
Compile with "g++ main.cpp -o pendelum"
run with "./pendelum" + (optionally) " length1 length2 mass1 mass2" 
ie you can input your own values (integers) for the length of the strings and mass of the weights.
example input:
    "./pendelum 15 15 10 11"
Note: This is an idealistic environment: ie perfectly stiff strings and no energy loss.
